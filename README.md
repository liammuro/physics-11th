## Frictional Forces

### Kinetic Friction

The friction experienced by surfaces sliding against one another. (object is moving)

### Kinetic Force

- kinetic force
- is a vector
- occurs between two objects
- one or both objects are in motion
- occurs at the point of contact between two surfaces
- opposes motion i.e. if object is sliding to the right, kinetic force point to the left

the kinetic frictional force depends on the normal force
$f_k=\mu_k N$
the constant $\mu_k$ is called the coefficient of kinetic friction

kinetic frictional force is independent of the relative speed og the surfaces, and of their area of contact

- static friction: the friction experienced by surfaces when the object is not in motion. (object is not moving)

### Static Force

- is a vector
- occurs between two objects
- objects are NOT in motion
- occurs at the point of contact between two surfaces
- opposes direction motion would occur in i.e. if a force is applied to the right of an object, but the object does not move, static force point to the left

Static frictional force

- the static frictional force has a maximum value, but may take on any value from zero to the maximum, depending of what is needed to keep the sum of forced zero.

max static friction:

$0 \leq f_s \leq f_{s\max}$

where

$f_{s\max} = \mu_s N$

the static frictional force is also independent of the area of contact and the relative speed of surfaces

## Strings & Springs

strings and springs

- when you pull on a string or rope, it becomes taut, we say there is tension in the string.

the tension in a real rope will vary along its length, due to

an ideal pulley is one that simply changes the direction of the tension

Kooke's law for springs states that the force increases with the amount thr spring is stretched or compressed

$F=kx$

the constant $k$ is called the spring constant

when an object is in transition equilibrium, the net force on it is zero

$\sum \vec{F} = 0$

this allows for the calculation of unknown forces

### Connected Objects

- When Forces are exerted on connected objects, their accelerations are the same
- If there are two objects connected by a string and we know the force and the masses, we can find the acceleration and tension

When there is a pulley, it is easiest to have the coordinate system follow the string

### Circular Motion

- missed note
- Some algebra gives us the magnitude of the acceleration, and therefor the force, required to keep an object of mass $m$ moving in a circle of radius $r$
- the magnitude of the force is given by

$f_{cp}=ma_{cp}=m\frac{v^2}{r}$

### Friction

Friction is due to microscopic roughness

Kinetic friction:

$d_k = \mu_kN$

### Work done by a constant force

SI unit: newton-meter

$(\text{N} \times \text{m}) = \text{Joule}, \text{J}$

If the force is in the same direction as the displacement:

$W = F d$

If the force is at an angle to the displacement:

$W = (F \cos \theta) d = Fd \cos \theta$

The work done may be positive, zero, or negative, depending on the angle between the force and the displacement:

If $\theta < 90 \degree, W > 0$ \
If $\theta = 90 \degree, W = 0$ \
If $\theta > 90 \degree, W < 0$

if there is more than one force acting on an object we can find the word done by each force, and aso the work done by the net force:

$W_\text{total} = (F_\text{total} \cos \theta) d = F_\text{total} d \cos \theta$
___

### Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem

When positive work is done on an object, its speed increases \
When negative work is done, its speed decreases

After algebraic manipulations of motion, we find:

$W_{total} = \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2$

therefor we define the kinetic energy :

$K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$

___

### January 18, 2023

### Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem

- Work-Energy Theorem: The total work done on an object is equal to its change in kinetic energy. \
$W_{total} = \Delta K = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2 - \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2$\
Where: $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$

### Work being done by a variable force

- The force needed to stretch an amount $x$ is $F = k x$

- Therefore, the work done in the stretching is $W = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$, where $\text{Area} = W$, and $kx$ is the height of the triangle

### Power

- Power is a measure of the rate at which work is done
$$P = \cfrac{W}{t}$$
SI unit: J/s = watt, W
1 horsepower = 1 hp = 746 W
$$P = \frac{fD}{t} = F \left( \frac{d}{t} \right) = Fv$$

### Conservative and Nonconservative Forces

### Conservative force

- The work it does is stored in the form of energy that can be released at a later time
- Conservative forces conserve mechanical energy
- i.e. gravity, the force of a spring

### Nonconservative force

- The work it does cannot ve recovered later as kinetic energy
- Nonconservative forces do not conserve mechanical energy
- i.e. friction

### Conservative vs Nonconservative forces on a closed path

Work done by conservative forces on a closed path is zero

- i.e. water in a closed water cooling loop

Work done by nonconservative forces on a closed path is not zero

- ie.

The work done by conservative force moving an object around any closed path is zero, this is not true for a nonconservative force.

### Energy formulae

Definition of potential energy, $U$:

$$W_C = U_i - U_f = - (U_f - U_i) = - \Delta U$$

SI unit: joule, $J$

Gravitational potential energy:

$$-\Delta U = U_i - U_f = W_C = m g \Delta y$$

Spring formula:

$$W_C = {1 \over 2} kx^2 = U_i - U_f$$

### Conservation of Mechanical Energy

Definition of mechanical energy:

$$E = U + K$$

Using this definition and considering only conservative forces, we find: $E_f = E_i$ or, equivalently, $E =$ constant.

### Rotational Kinetic Energy and the Movement of Inertia

$$K = {1 \over 2} mv^2 = {1 \over 2} (mr^2)\omega^2$$

We can also write kinetic energy as ${1 \over 2}I \omega^2$, where $I$, the moment of inertia, is given by: $$I = \sum{m_1r_i^2}$$

### Conservation of Energy

The total kinetic energy of a rolling object is the sum of its linear and rotational kinetic energy

$$K = {1 \over 2} mv^2  + {1 \over 2} I \omega^2$$
$$=  {1 \over 2} mv^2  + {1 \over 2} I \left ({v \over r} \right)^2$$
$$= {1 \over 2} mv^2 \left( 1+ {I \over mr} \right)^2 $$

### Torque

Definition of Torque, $\tau$, for a Tangential Force: $$\tau = rF$$

SI unit: $\rm{N} \times m$

General definition of Torque, $\tau$:
$$\tau = r(F \sin{\theta})$$

SI unit: $\rm{N} \times m$

- If the torque causes a counterclockwise angular acceleration, it is positive; if it causes a clockwise angular acceleration, it is negative.

### Newtons second law for rotational motion

Newtons second law for rotational motion:
$$\alpha F {F \over m}$$
$$\alpha = {rF \over mr^2} = {\tau \over I}$$

or equivalently,

Newtons second law for rotational motion:
$$\tau = I \alpha$$

### Dynamic Applications of torque

When dealing with systems that have both rotating parts and translating parts, we must be careful to account for all forces and torques correctly,

### Angular momentum

Definition of angular momentum, $L$:
$$L = I \omega$$

SI Unit: $\rm kg \times m^2 / s$

$$L = rmv = rp$$

Angular momentum, $L$ for a point particle

$$L = rp \sin{\theta} = rmv \sin{\theta}$$

SI Unit: $\rm kg \times m^2 / s$

$${\Delta L \over \Delta t} = I {\Delta \omega \over \Delta t} = I \alpha$$

$$\tau = I \alpha  = {\Delta L \over \Delta t}$$

### Rotational work and power

A torque acting through an angular displacement does work, just as a force acting through a distance does.

Work Done by Torque:
$$W = \tau \Delta \theta$$

The work energy theorem applies as usual.

### Gravity

#### Kepler's Laws

1. Planets follow elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse.
2. As a planet moves in its orbit, it sweeps out an equal amount of area in an equal amount of time.
3. The period, $T$, of a planet increases as its mean distance from the Sun, $r$, raised to the $3/2$ power.
$$T = (\text{constant})r^{3/2}$$

The constant varies depending on the mass being orbited. This can be shown to be a consequence of the inverse square form of the gravitational force.

$$T^2 = {4 \pi ^2 \over GM} a^3$$
$$T^2 = a^3$$

#### Gravitational Potential Energy

Gravitational potential energy of an object of mass $m$ a distance $r$ from Earth's center:
$$U = -G {m M_E \over r}$$

Very close to the Earth's surface, the gravitational potential energy increases linearly

#### Energy Conservation

Total mechanical energy of an object of mass $m$ a distance $r$ from the center of the Earth:

$$E = K + U = {1 \over 2} m v^2 - G {m M_E \over r}$$

Escape speed: the initial upward speed a projectile must have in order to escape from the Earth's Gravity:

$$v_e = \sqrt{{2 m M_E \over R_E}} = 11200 \text{ m/s} \approx 25000 \text{ mi/h}$$

Gravity Formulae:

Force of gravity between two point masses:
$$F = G {m_1 m_2 \over r^2}$$

## Chapter 14: Waves and Sound

### Tuesday May 09, 2023

Types of waves

A wave is a disturbance that propagates from one place to another

The easiest type of wave to  visualize is a transverse wave, where the displacement if the medium is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the wave.

In a  longitudinal wave, the displacement is along the direction of wave motion.

Wavelength $\lambda$: distance over which wave repeats

Period $T$: time for one wavelength to pass a given point

Frequency $f$: $f = 1/T$

Speed of a wave:

$$v = {\text{distance} \over \text{time}} = {\lambda \over T} = \lambda f$$

Definition of Mass per Length, $\mu$

$$\mu = \text{mass per length} = m/L$$

Speed of a wave on a string, $v$

$$v = \sqrt{F \over \mu}$$

When a wave reaches the end of a string, it will be reflected. If the end is fixed, the reflected wave will be inverted.

Harmonic wave functions

Since the wave has the same pattern at $x + \lambda$ as it does at $x$, the wave must be of the form

$$y(x) = A \cos{{2 \pi \over \lambda} x }$$

Also as the wave propagates in time, the peak moves as

$$x = \lambda {t \over T}$$

Combining yields the dull wave equationL

$$y(x,t) = A \cos{ \left[ {2 \pi \over \lambda} \left( x - \lambda {t \over T} \right) \right]}$$

$$y(x,t) = A \cos{ \left( {2 \pi \over \lambda} x - {2 \pi \over T} t \right) }$$

Ina sound wave, the density and pressure of the air (or other medium carrying the sound) are the quantities that oscillate.

Sound intensity

the intensity of a sound is the amount of energy that passes through a given area in a given time

$$I = {E \over At}$$

Expressed in terms of power:

Definition of intensity:

$$I = {P \over A}$$

SI unit: $\text{W} / \text{m}^2$

Sound intensity from a point source will decrease as the square of the distance.

Intensity with distance, from a point source:

$$I = {P \over 4 \pi r^2}$$

SI unit: $\text{W} / \text{m}^2$

When you listen to a variety of sounds, a sound that seems twice as loud as loud as another is ten times more intense. Therefore, we use a logarithmic scale to define intensity values.

Definition of intensity level, $\beta$
$$\beta = 10 \log(I/I_0)$$
SI unit: dimensionless

Here, $I_0$ is the faintest sound that can be heard:

$$I_0 = 10^{-12} \text{ W} / \text{m}^2$$

Standing waves

Standing waves can also be excited in columns of air, such as soda bottles, woodwind instruments, or organ pipes.

One end is a node, $\text{N}$, and the other end is an antinode, $\text{A}$.

For a tube with one open end, the fundamental wavelength is 4 times the length of the pipe, and only odd numbered harmonics appear.

If the tube is open on both ends, both ends are antinodes, and the sequence of harmonics is the same as that on a string.

Beats

Beats are an interference pattern in time, rather than in space. If two sounds are very close in frequency, their sum also has a periodic time dependance, although with a much lower frequency.

Beat frequency is the absolute value of the difference between two frequencies occurring simultaneously. This represents the frequency of successive maximum intensities of beats.

$$f_{\text{beat}} = |f_1-f_2|$$

Speed of a wave on a string:
$$v = \sqrt{F\over \mu}$$

Wave function for a harmonic wave:
$$y(x,t) = A \cos \left( {2 \pi \over \lambda} x - {2 \pi \over T} \right) \$$

$I =$ Current

$V =$ potential difference

$R =$ depends on material

Wires present some resistance to the motion of electrons. Ohm's law relates the voltage to the current:\
Ohm's Law:\
$V = IR$\
SI unit: volt, $\text{V}$

$$R = {V \over I}$$

$$\Omega$$

Definition of resistivity, $p$
$$R = p \left( {L \over A  }\right)$$

$$\Delta U - (\Delta Q) V$$

Electrical Power:\
$P = IV$\
SI unit: watt, $\text{W}$

Equivalent resistance for resistors in series:
$$R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots = \sum{R}$$
SI unit: ohm, $\Omega$

Equivalent resistance for resistors in parallel:
$${1 \over R_{\text{eq}}} = {1 \over R_1} + {1 \over R_2} + {1 \over R_3} + \dots = \sum{1 \over R}$$
SI unit: ohm, $\Omega$\
Relation due to potential difference across parallel resistors being the same for each.
