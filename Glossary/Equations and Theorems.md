## Essential Theorems of the Physical World

### Newtons Laws of Motion

1. If the net force on an object is zero, its velocity is constant. \
    An object in motion will remain in motion until acted on by an outside force.

2. When an object of mass $m$ is acted on by a net force $F$, then the object will have an acceleration $a$ associated with it the is related to the force \
    $F = ma$

3. If object 1 exerts force $F$ on object 2, then object 2 exerts force $-F$ on object 1. \
    Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
