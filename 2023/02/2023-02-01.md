## Conservative and Nonconservative Forces

### Conservative force

- The work it does is stored in the form of energy that can be released at a later time
- Conservative forces conserve mechanical energy
- i.e. gravity, the force of a spring

### Nonconservative force

- The work it does cannot ve recovered later as kinetic energy
- Nonconservative forces do not conserve mechanical energy
- i.e. friction

### Conservative vs Nonconservative forces on a closed path

Work done by conservative forces on a closed path is zero

- i.e. water in a closed water cooling loop

Work done by nonconservative forces on a closed path is not zero

- ie.

The work done by conservative force moving an object around any closed path is zero, this is not true for a nonconservative force.

## Energy formulae

Definition of potential energy, $U$

$W_C = U_i - U_f = - (U_f - U_i) = - \Delta U$

SI unit: joule, J

Gravitational potential energy:

$-\Delta U = U_i - U_f = W_C = m g \Delta y$

Spring formula

$W_C = {1 \over 2} kx^2 = U_i - U_f$

### Conservation of Mechanical Energy

Definition of mechanical energy:

$E = U + K$

Using this definition and considering only conservative forces, we find: $E_f = E_i$ or, equivalently, $E =$ constant.
