### Friction
Friction is due to microspopic roughness

Kinetic friction: 

$d_k = \mu_kN$

### Work done by a constant force
SI unit: newton-meter

$(\text{N} * \text{m}) = \text{Joule}, \text{J}$


If the force is in the same direction as the displacement: 

$W = F d$

If the force is at an angle to the displacement: 

$W = (F \cos \theta) d = Fd \cos \theta$


The owrk done may be positive, zero, or negative, depending on the angle between the force and the displanecment: 

If $\theta < 90 \degree, W > 0$ \
If $\theta = 90 \degree, W = 0$ \
If $\theta > 90 \degree, W < 0$

if there is more than one force acting on an object we can find the word done by eacg force, and aso the work done by the net force: 

$W_\text{total} = (F_\text{total} \cos \theta) d = F_\text{total} d \cos \theta$

### Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem
When positive work is done on an object, its speed increases \
When negative work is done, its speed decreases
