### Friction

Friction is due to microscopic roughness

Kinetic friction:

$d_k = \mu_kN$

### Work done by a constant force

SI unit: newton-meter

$(\text{N} * \text{m}) = \text{Joule}, \text{J}$

If the force is in the same direction as the displacement:

$W = F d$

If the force is at an angle to the displacement:

$W = (F \cos \theta) d = Fd \cos \theta$

The work done may be positive, zero, or negative, depending on the angle between the force and the displacement:

If $\theta < 90 \degree, W > 0$ \
If $\theta = 90 \degree, W = 0$ \
If $\theta > 90 \degree, W < 0$

if there is more than one force acting on an object we can find the word done by each force, and aso the work done by the net force:

$W_\text{total} = (F_\text{total} \cos \theta) d = F_\text{total} d \cos \theta$
___

### Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem

When positive work is done on an object, its speed increases \
When negative work is done, its speed decreases

After algebraic manipulations of motion, we find:

$W_{total} = \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2$

therefor we define the kinetic energy :

$K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$
