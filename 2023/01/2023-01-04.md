# Physics Notes - Friction


## Frictional Forces



### Kinetic Friction: 
The friction expreiebced by surfaces sliding against one another. (object is moving) 


### Kinetic Force

- kinetic force
- is a vector 
- occurs between two objects
- one or both objects are in motion
- occcurs at the point of contact between two surfaces
- opposes motion i.e. if object is sliding to the right, kinetic force point to the left

the kinetic frictional force depends on the normal force 
$f_k=\mu_k N$
the constant $\mu_k$ is called the coeficcient of kitentic friction 


kinetic frictional force is independant of the relative speed og the surfaces, and of their area of contact


- static friction: the friction expreiebced by surfaces when the object is not in motion. (object is not moving)

### Static Force
- is a vector 
- occurs between two objects
- objects are NOT in motion
- occcurs at the point of contact between two surfaces
- opposes direction motion would occur in i.e. if a force is applied to the right of an object, but the object does not move, static force point to the left


Static frictional force
- the static frictional force has a maximum value, but may take on any value from zero to the maximum, depending of what is needed to keep the sum of forced zero. 

max static friction: 

$0 \leq f_s \leq f_{s\max}$

where

$f_{s\max} = \mu_s N$

the static frictional force is also independant of the area of contact and the reative speed of surfaces


## Strings & Springs

strings and springs 
- when you pull on a string or rope it pucomes taut, we say there is tension in the string. 


the tension in a real rope will vary along its length, due to 

an ideal pully is one that simply changes the direction of the tension

Kooke's law for springs states that the force increases with the ammount thr spring is stretched or compressed

$F=kx$

the constant $k$ is called the spring constant



when an object is in transition equilibriam, the net force on it is zero

$\sum \vec{F} = 0$

this allows for the calculation of unknown forces

### Connected Objects
- When Forces are extetes on connected objects, their accelerations are the same
- If there are two objects connected by a string and we know the force and the masses, we can find the acceleration and tension

When there is a pully, it is easiest to have the coordinate system follow the string

### Circular Motion 
- missed note
- Some algebra gives us the magnitude of the acceleration, and therefor the force, required to keep an object of mass $m$ moving in a circle of radius $r$
- the magnitude of the force is given by 

$f_{cp}=ma_{cp}=m\frac{v^2}{r}$
